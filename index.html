My name is Eyob. I am originally from Ethiopia and moved to the USA in mid 2015.

Before I migrate to the USA I worked as sales and IT person in Ethiopia, Me and my wife are parents to a sweet three years girl and a one year old boy. Currently am working as independent truck owner mostly I do my state of Washington and Oregon.

Life was going seemingly fine for us until we realized I am not having enough time to actually live and enjoy life with my family.I was always searching for something that I can learn and work with out .
